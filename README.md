# UFO

Overview of Project 
#purpose of this analysis
   - Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.
   - This new assignment consists of one technical analysis deliverable and a written report

Deliverable 1:

Using JavaScript and HTML, i'm modifying the code in my index.html file to create more table filters. In addition to the date filter I created in this module, I’ll add filters for the city, state, country, and shape, as shown in the following image:
The UFO finder web page with filters for the date, city, state, country, and shape for filtering the data.

Using JavaScript, I’ll replace the handleClick() function in your app.js file with a new function that saves the element, value, and id of the filter that was changed. Then, I’ll create a new function to loop through the dataset and keep only the results that match the search criteria. The webpage will be updated with the search criteria after pressing "Enter".

Results

#Describing how someone might use the new webpage by walking through the process of using the search criteria. 
#Use images of my webpage during the filtering process to support my explanation.


Summary


#describing one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.
